						Pawske Party is just the beginning of the Easter holiday.
						<br>
						What are you gonna do with all those other days?
					</p>
					<p>
						Fear not, Oslo has a lot to offer. From the new National Museum and the controversial
						Munch Museum, to historical sites like Middelalderparken and Akershus
						Fortress you can easily spend days in the worlds of art and history.
					</p>
					<p>
						From Frognerparken to the Opera, Oslo is a destination for design and
						architecture. You can have a great day just wandering the streets enjoying the sights.
					</p>
					<p>
						While not recognized on the same level as Copenhagen, Oslo still has a lot to offer on the
						restaurant front. From our 3 star Michelin restaurant Maaemo, to street food halls
						and waffle stands there is something for everyone. Fancy a cocktail after dinner? Oslo houses
						some world class bars, including the legendary Himkok.
					</p>
					<p>
						On top of all there is to see and do within the city, Oslo are surrounded by forest with
						excellent hiking opportunities, and nearby several interesting places like Drøbak,
						Fredrikstad and Halden.
					</p>
