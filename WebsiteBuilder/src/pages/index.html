                Three days of fun await you in Oslo, Norway. The main day is of course Easter Friday,
                which is April 18th
                next year, but things are happening both before and after.

              <div class="textblock">

                On Thursday April 17th you can join us for a touristic city walk during the day, and our
                traditional early
                arrival bowling in the evening.
                Saturday the 19th sees the return of the Dead Dog Afternoon. More information about that
                later.
