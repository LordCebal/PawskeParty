            Aker Brygge. The meetup point will be at Vinkelplassen at Majorstua by 11:00. We will depart
            shortly thereafter.

          <div class="textblock">The first stop will be the world famous Frognerparken, with its sculpture

            industrial area turned into fancy office space. From there we will cross the highway and follow
